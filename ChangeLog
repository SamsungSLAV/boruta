Release 0.2.0 - Thu Mar. 07 2019 - Maciej Wereski <m.wereski@partner.samsung.com>
================================================================================
* Added README
* HTTP API:
  - sorting and pagination support for filtering requests/workers
  - listing methods signatures was changed to allow pagination and sorting
  - removal of GET on api/v1/reqs and api/v1/workers as pagination is
  mandatory so it may be impossible to get all items in some cases
  - single fields in Requests filter (Priority, State) were replaced by slices
    ('any of' behaviour). Slice of IDs was added.
  - CORS support
  - unification of names of Boruta-specific headers
* Dryad state behaviour during successive registers:
  - if there were changes in the Drayd config then it'll be put in MAINTENANCE
  - otherwise if it was in FAILED state it will be put in IDLE state
* other small fixes and tests improvements
